# An overview of the bot dashboard
> WIP

# Under construction!
As of july, we are still working on the website, and we plan to fully release it by tne end of 2022 / early 2023, please be patient as we are actively trying to make it better and ready for public release. Currently, the dashboard is only being actively worked on by one person (me), we cannot promise a garunteed date of release, however we are trying our best to make sure that the dashboard experience is as good as it can be, so please be patient.

## What we are working on...
Currently we aim to release the dashboard with the following features:
1. Simple server control with an easy to use interface
1. An easy way to configure server member join and leave events
1. A good set of features to let us "stand out from the croud"
1. Useful and in-depth server analytics to help server owners grow their server!
1. Good automod logging features.

## How can you help?
Once the website is fully released, we would love your feedback and suggestions as to how we could improve our website. As for right now however, you can open an issue if you have a suggesstion that you would like to see implemented.

## How to access the dashboard
To access the dashboard, you need to first login with your discord account. When the website requests access to your discord account, select authorize. This will log you into your personal Uxtron bot dashboard.

## Next steps
The dashboard acts like a central control center for the Uxtron bot for each individual server with the bot. It is where you can configure and customize the Uxtron bot for your own servers. To start customizing the bot, you need to first choose a server. After you choose the server, everything you configure will be for that server.

# An overview of the bot dashboard
> WIP

## How to access the dashboard
To access the dashboard, you need to first login with your discord account. When the website requests access to your discord account, select authorize. This will log you into your personal Uxtron bot dashboard.

## Next steps
The dashboard acts like a central control center for the Uxtron bot for each individual server with the bot. It is where you can configure and customize the Uxtron bot for your own servers. To start customizing the bot, you need to first choose a server. After you choose the server, everything you configure will be for that server.

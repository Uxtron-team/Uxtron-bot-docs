# Moderation features
The Uxtron bot containes many moderation features like user management (muting members, kicking members, etc.) that help you build your discord community to the highest level. These features are relatively easy to use but if you want a few pointers or tips on how to use these features, continue reading below.

## Setting up these features/commands
You can configure the features in the dashboard (WIP) or by using the `/cmdconfig` command.

### Dashboard
> The dashboard is WIP (Work In Progress).

### /cmdconfig
To configure commands using `cmdconfig`, you simply run the command `/cmdconfig` (note that 'cmdconfig' requires **manage server** permissions) and select the feature you want to configure.


Steps:
1. run /cmdconfig
2. select a feature
3. choose the options provided and make changes to them.


If you have finished the steps above, test if the features you changes have been modified! If they have not been changed, wait for a while and if it still doesn't change, contact support.

> **Note**<br />
> You can also enable and disable features and commands with the /cmdconfig command

## Feature/command usage
Now that you have finished setting up all your features and commands, you can use them easily!

### Features
Features that you enabled via the dashboard, or the /cmdconfig command (see above) will now be activated and will always be on (unless disabled). For example, if you enable the anti-profanity feature, it will always check for profanity and perform the action specified when configuring the feature.

### Commands
After configuring a command, you can use the command by typing in `/[configured command]` and any other arguments required.

## Working with advanced command configuration
Working with avanced command configuration is pretty simple once you know how to do it so here are a few pointers to get you on the right path!

To start with advanced command configuration, head over to the dashboard ([click here to learn more about the dashboard](https://github.com/Uxtron-team/Uxtron-bot-docs/tree/main/docs/website)) and choose a server you want to bot to change in. Next, select a module (commands or features) and start configuring it! It might take a while for your changes to get sent to the bot so please be patient after you finish customizing the modules.

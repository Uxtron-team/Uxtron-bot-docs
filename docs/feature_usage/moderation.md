# Moderation features
The Uxtron bot containes many moderation features like user management (muting members, kicking members, etc.) that help you build your discord community to the highest level. These features are relatively easy to use but if you want a few pointers or tips on how to use these features, please continue reading below.

## Setting up these features/commands
If you haven't activated the bot in your server yet, run `/activate` and if the bot doesn't return any errors (if it does, contact support), you're good to go!'

Most features have a command to configure these features seperately. If you don't find a command for that, you can configure the features in the dashboard (WIP) or by using the `/cmdconfig` command.

### Dashboard
> The dashboard is WIP (Work In Progress).

### Using each command's own configuration command
If you can find the specific configuration command for a command, here's how to use it. If you can't use the `/cmdconfig` command [/cmdconfig usage info](###/cmdconfig)



### /cmdconfig
To configure commands using `cmdconfig`, you simply run the command `/cmdconfig` (note that 'cmdconfig' requires **manage server** permissions) and select the feature you want to configure.

Steps:
- run /cmdconfig
- select a feature
- choose the options provided and make changes to them.

If you have finished the steps above, test if the features you changes have been modified! If they have not been changed, wait for a while and if it still doesn't change, contact support.

| **TIP**: If a feature is disabed, you can also use `/cmdconfig` to activate them! |

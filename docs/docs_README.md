# Welcome to the Uxtron bot documentation!
This is where you will find detailed explanations on everything to do with the Uxtron bot. If you want a simple overview, [click here](https://github.com/Uxtron-team/Uxtron-bot-docs/wiki).

## Format
If you see something in `this format`, it is technical things. Usually, only commands or arguments will be in `this format` but sometimes, other things will be in there too.

### Code block format (`this`)
[] - a placeholder/variable<br />
When you see the documentation include something like 'type in `/[specified command]`', it doesn't mean type in '/[specified command]'. It means type the 'specified command'.

# Slash commands
Slash commands are very simple. As the name suggests, they are commands with a slash (`/`) prefix.

## Usage
To use slash commands, simply type `/` and choose from the list of commands the bots in your server provide! If you already know the command you are going to type, you can also type in `/` and the command you are going to execute e.g: `/mute`
